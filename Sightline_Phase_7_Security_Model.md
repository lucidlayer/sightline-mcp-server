# Sightline MCP Suite â€” Phase 7: Security Model (Ultra-Detailed)

---

## Overview

Define **comprehensive security architecture and controls** for Sightline:

- Sandboxing
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- Access control
- Authentication/authorization
- Encryption
- Audit logging
- Attack surface minimization

---

## 7.1. **Sandboxing**

- Run browser automation in isolated containers or headless browser sandboxes.
- Restrict filesystem access to allowed directories.
- Use OS-level sandboxing (seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux).
- Limit network access to prevent SSRF.

---

## 7.2. **Input Validation**

- Strict JSON schema validation on all inputs.
- Whitelist allowed URL schemes and domains.
- Size limits on uploads and requests.
- Reject malformed or suspicious data early.

---

## 7.3. **Output Sanitization**

- Strip scripts, event handlers, and unsafe content from HTML/Markdown.
- Escape user-generated content in reports.
- Validate and sanitize OCR/ASR outputs.

---

## 7.4. **Access Control**

- Role-based access for agents, developers, reviewers.
- Directory-level permissions in filesystem.
- Graph entity/relation access policies.
- Task and workflow access restrictions.

---

## 7.5. **Authentication & Authorization**

- API keys or tokens for MCP tool access.
- Optional OAuth2 or SSO integration.
- Per-tool and per-user permissions.
- Audit failed auth attempts.

---

## 7.6. **Encryption**

- TLS for all network communication.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (snapshots, logs, graph).
- Use OS-level disk encryption where possible.

---

## 7.7. **Audit Logging**

- Log all tool invocations, inputs, outputs, errors.
- Log file access, graph changes, task executions.
- Log authentication events.
- Protect logs from tampering.

---

## 7.8. **Attack Surface Minimization**

- Disable unused MCP tools and endpoints.
- Limit network egress from containers.
- Use minimal OS images.
- Regularly update dependencies.
- Run with least privilege.

---

## 7.9. **Threats & Mitigations**

- **SSRF:** Validate URLs, restrict network.
- **XSS:** Sanitize outputs.
- **Code Injection:** Validate inputs, sandbox execution.
- **Data Leakage:** Access control, encryption.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Rate limits, quotas.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Auth, audit, least privilege.

---

*Each security control will be expanded with detailed configs, examples, and best practices in the next steps.*
