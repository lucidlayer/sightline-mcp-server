# Sightline MCP Suite â€” Phase 8: Deployment Architecture (Ultra-Detailed)

---

## Overview

Define **deployment strategies and infrastructure** for Sightline:

- Local development
- Containerization
- Environment configuration
- Persistent storage
- Networking
- Scaling
- Monitoring
- CI/CD pipelines

---

## 8.1. **Local Development**

- Use Docker Compose for multi-container setup.
- Provide local `.env` files for configuration.
- Hot-reload for Node.js services.
- Mock data and test scripts.
- Developer documentation and onboarding guides.

---

## 8.2. **Containerization**

- Dockerfiles for each MCP server/component.
- Minimal base images (Alpine, distroless).
- Multi-stage builds for smaller images.
- Compose files for orchestration.
- Named volumes for persistent data (memory graph, filesystem, logs).
- Network isolation between components.

---

## 8.3. **Environment Variables**

- API keys (if any, optional).
- Allowed directories.
- Storage paths.
- Resource limits.
- Logging levels.
- Feature flags.

---

## 8.4. **Persistent Storage**

- Named Docker volumes or host mounts.
- Separate volumes for:
  - Memory graph data
  - Filesystem storage
  - Logs
  - Snapshots
  - Task queues
- Backup and restore scripts.

---

## 8.5. **Networking**

- Internal Docker network for inter-service communication.
- Expose MCP endpoints on localhost or internal IP.
- Optional reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik) for unified API gateway.
- TLS termination at proxy.

---

## 8.6. **Scaling**

- Stateless components (snapshot, markdown, validation) can be horizontally scaled.
- Stateful components (memory, filesystem) require volume sharing or clustering.
- Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration (future).
- Load balancing via proxy.

---

## 8.7. **Monitoring & Logging**

- Centralized log aggregation (ELK, Loki, etc.).
- Health checks for each service.
- Metrics collection (Prometheus).
- Alerting on failures, resource exhaustion.

---

## 8.8. **CI/CD Pipelines**

- Linting, testing, building containers.
- Version tagging and release management.
- Automated deployment to dev/staging/prod.
- Rollback support.
- Secrets management.

---

## 8.9. **Update & Maintenance**

- Rolling updates with zero downtime.
- Backup before upgrades.
- Migration scripts for data/schema changes.
- Automated dependency updates (Renovate, Dependabot).

---

*Each deployment aspect will be expanded with configs, scripts, and best practices in the next steps.*
