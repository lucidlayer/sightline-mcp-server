# Sightline MCP Suite â€” Phase 9: Extensibility & Customization (Ultra-Detailed)

---

## Overview

Define **extension points, plugin interfaces, and customization options** for Sightline:

- Plugin architecture
- Configuration schemas
- Custom validation rules
- Custom diff algorithms
- Reasoning strategies
- UI integrations
- Third-party tool integration

---

## 9.1. **Plugin Architecture**

- Define plugin API for each component.
- Support dynamic loading of plugins at runtime.
- Isolate plugins in sandboxed environments.
- Provide hooks for:
  - Snapshot post-processing
  - Markdown post-processing
  - Validation rules
  - Diff algorithms
  - Task orchestration
  - Reasoning steps
  - Graph operations
  - File operations

---

## 9.2. **Configuration Schemas**

- JSON/YAML config files.
- Enable/disable components and plugins.
- Set resource limits, timeouts, feature flags.
- Define access control policies.
- Override default schemas and thresholds.

---

## 9.3. **Custom Validation Rules**

- Register new validation functions.
- Compose rules with AND/OR/NOT logic.
- Set tolerance thresholds.
- Add domain-specific checks (e.g., accessibility, branding).

---

## 9.4. **Custom Diff Algorithms**

- Register new diff strategies.
- Visual diff plugins (e.g., perceptual hashing).
- DOM diff plugins (e.g., semantic diffs).
- Style diff plugins (e.g., color contrast).
- Text diff plugins (e.g., fuzzy matching).

---

## 9.5. **Reasoning Strategies**

- Plug in new chain-of-thought algorithms.
- Add hypothesis testing modules.
- Integrate external LLMs or symbolic reasoners.
- Support multi-agent coordination plugins.

---

## 9.6. **UI Integrations**

- Embed Sightline in IDEs, dashboards, or browsers.
- Provide REST/gRPC/WebSocket APIs.
- Support webhooks and event subscriptions.
- Custom visualization plugins for diffs, graphs, workflows.

---

## 9.7. **Third-Party Tool Integration**

- Connectors for CI/CD, version control, issue trackers.
- Human-in-the-loop review tools.
- Notification systems (Slack, email).
- Data export/import plugins.

---

## 9.8. **Security & Isolation**

- Sandbox plugins with resource limits.
- Validate plugin manifests and signatures.
- Audit plugin activity.
- Provide plugin permission model.

---

*Each extensibility point will be expanded with APIs, examples, and best practices in the next steps.*
