# Sightline MCP Suite — Phase 11: Testing Strategy (Ultra-Detailed)

---

## Overview

Define **comprehensive testing strategy** for Sightline:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Performance tests
- Security tests
- Continuous testing

---

## 11.1. **Unit Tests**

- Snapshot engine: DOM extraction, style computation, screenshot capture.
- Markdown conversion: HTML parsing, OCR, ASR.
- Validation logic: property matching, fuzzy matching.
- Diff algorithms: pixel, DOM, style, text.
- Task queue: enqueue, dequeue, dependencies.
- Reasoning: step generation, revisions, branches.
- Graph operations: CRUD, search, relations.
- Filesystem: file I/O, metadata, versioning.

---

## 11.2. **Integration Tests**

- Snapshot + validation + diff pipeline.
- Markdown conversion + validation.
- Task orchestration with retries and failures.
- Reasoning with multi-step chains.
- Graph updates with snapshots and validations.
- Filesystem with large files and concurrency.

---

## 11.3. **End-to-End Tests**

- Full agent workflows: fix → snapshot → validate → diff → retry.
- Human-in-the-loop review flows.
- Multi-agent coordination.
- UI interactions (CLI, API, dashboard).

---

## 11.4. **Performance Tests**

- Large DOMs and snapshots.
- High concurrency on task queues.
- Bulk graph operations.
- File I/O under load.
- OCR/ASR on large media files.

---

## 11.5. **Security Tests**

- Input fuzzing.
- SSRF attempts.
- XSS injection.
- Unauthorized access.
- Resource exhaustion (DoS).
- Plugin sandbox escapes.

---

## 11.6. **Continuous Testing**

- Automated in CI/CD pipelines.
- Code coverage tracking.
- Regression test suites.
- Performance baselines.
- Security scanning (SAST, DAST).
- Flaky test detection.

*Each test type will be expanded with detailed cases, data, and automation scripts in the next steps.*
