# Sightline MCP Suite â€” Phase 5: Internal Algorithms (Ultra-Detailed)

---

## Overview

Define **detailed algorithms and pseudocode** for all core Sightline components:

- DOM traversal and serialization
- Style computation
- Screenshot capture
- OCR and transcription
- Markdown conversion
- Validation logic
- Diffing (visual, DOM, style, text)
- Task queue management
- Reasoning step generation
- Graph updates
- File operations
